5.) Detailed view into Kubernetes Objects:
------------------------------------------

Understand Pods:
----------------
Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A pod is scheduled on the one node, ensuring co-location of containers.

Key features:
- A pod can contain one or more containers
- Containers within a pod share the same network namespace and can communicate via localhost
- Ephemeral in nature, and can be created, destroyed, and recreated dynamically.

Pod Lifecycle: Pods have a defined lifecycle with states like Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, and Unknown.

handson:
- Get Pods status
- Describe Pods // kubectl describe pod aws-node-5z5hq -n kube-system
- Check the logs // kubectl logs aws-load-balancer-controller-6cb4b5dc7f-fwcwm -n kube-system
- Delete the pod
- check the pod manifest
- understand the init containers and multi-container / sidecar container use case
    - sample: manifests\multi-container-pod-demo.yaml
- Logs of a container: kubectl logs multi-container-example -c log-sidecar
- validate all the states of pod lifecycle
    - sample: manifests\pod-lifecycle-demo.yaml

Note: Not possible to simulate a unknown state pod, it typically occurs when the kubelet can't report on the status of a pod, often due to communication issues between the kubelet and the API server.

Understanding the Kubernetes ReplicaSet & Deployment Object:
------------------------------------------------------------

ReplicaSets: ReplicaSets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

Key features:
- Maintains a stable set of replica Pods
- Ensures high availability
- Allows easy scaling of applications


Deployments: Deployments provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Key features:
- Describe desired state
- Control the rate of change to Pods
- Provide rollback functionality


Why deployment over replicasets:

- Deployments provide built-in support for rolling updates and easy rollbacks
- Deployments maintain a revision history, allowing you to roll back to previous versions
- Deployments offer configurable update strategies like RollingUpdate and Recreate
- Deployments act as a higher-level abstraction, managing ReplicaSets behind the scenes


handson:
- check the deployment manifest
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-deployment-demo.yaml
- deploy this
- Get deployment status // kuectl get deployment -n default
- Describe deployment
- Check the logs
- check the replicasets created from the deployment Object
- check the pods created from the replicaset object
- manually scale the deployment // kubectl scale deployment product-catalog-demo --replicas=5
- update the deployment with the latest application version // change the image from nginx to httpd
- rollback the deployment to the older version // kubectl rollout undo deployment/product-catalog
- delete the deployment


Understanding the Kubernetes Service Object:
--------------------------------------------

Services provide network access to a set of Pods.

Types of Services:
a.) ClusterIP: Exposes the service on an internal IP in the cluster
b.) NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port, but generally used in Non-prod scenarios, mention the range - (30000 - 32767)
c.) LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer

Key features:
Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of Pods
Enables seamless service discovery and load balancing within the cluster
Abstract the underlying Pod network, allowing applications to communicate without knowing the exact Pod IPs, which can change frequently.

handson:
- check the following service manifest
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-service-cip-demo.yaml
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-service-np-demo.yaml
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-service-lb-demo.yaml
- Deploy the services
- Get service status
- Describe service
- Check the logs

Check the ClusterIp service by getting inside a container in the same namespace:
e.g.: 
- kubectl exec -it running-pod -- bash
- 

Understanding the Kubernetes ConfigMaps & Secrets Object:
---------------------------------------------------------

ConfigMaps allow us to decouple configuration artifacts from image content.

Key features:
- Store non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs or files.
- Can be mounted as volumes or used as environment variables in Pods.

Secrets are used to store and manage sensitive information.

Key features:
- Secrets are stored in a base64 encoded format
- Store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens) with encryption at rest in etcd.
- Can be mounted as volumes or used as environment variables in Pods, similar to ConfigMaps, but with additional security measures.


handson:
- check the manifest files
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-cm-demo.yaml
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-secret-string-data-demo.yaml
    - sample: manifests\pcatalog-secret-data-demo.yaml
- Apply them
- Check their accesibility in the Pods which are created via the deployment
